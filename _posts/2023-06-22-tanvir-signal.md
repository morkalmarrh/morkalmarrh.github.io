## Children of Strange Moons

 Tanvir Suleiman is a skilled pilot from Espergloria's moon, reticent about his origins, and tattooed with violet ore that seems more fitted to a soldier than an underpaid courier. Signal sov Mu is his boss's new cargo: the first GAEL not to be constructed by human hands, if he's to be believed. She's looking for Mahnoor Adama, an escapee from a shadowy Esperglorian faction that still follow the ways of the Aesthete; his mentor's missing daughter.
