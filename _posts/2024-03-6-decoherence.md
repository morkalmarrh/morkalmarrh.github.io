[![Cognito Hazard](/assets/img/cognitohazard5thumb.png#circ)](/assets/img/cognitohazard5.png)

This was my first full image in Rebelle 5. It's a difficult process at first, somewhere between traditional & digital work. But I'm very happy with the result. 
I've called it Decoherence in the end based on 'superimposed states', though the working concept was a cognito hazard, the idea of knowledge which is injurious to a person. Hence the eye situation.
