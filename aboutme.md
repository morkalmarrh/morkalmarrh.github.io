I'm Morgan (they/he/it). I'm a scientist from the UK, currently querying [Fifth-type](https://morkalmarrh.github.io/fifthtype/). It's a New Weird novel set in the city of Verinn, about a laboratory beneath the sea that studies the human soul - at any cost. Much of my art depicts characters from this world.
