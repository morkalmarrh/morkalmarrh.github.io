I'm Mog (EN: [they](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/), FR: iel, DE: xier), a third year PhD student in Plant Virology. I mostly like to focus on the Bioinformatics side and offloading repetetive tasks to my robot overlords. In my free time, I paint (portfolio page/site pending), write and make music, but mostly I have to admit I just play video games.
