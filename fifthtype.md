title: Fifth-type
---

It's said that those who are forgotten return to this world as flowers. Fifth-type is set in the city of Verinn, a monstrous conurbation built on a superstructure sunk into the sea-bed. It expands ever-upwards as its lower reaches collapse into the ocean below.

Trigger is a man who does not know his own species. Five years ago, he was found drifting near a wandering island which visits the mainland only once ever few centuries. Since then, he has been trying to crawl up through the city and into the light. Instead, he will be led to the lowest reaches, where the pressure crushes land-dwellers like a fist - to Atomos, the laboratory which studies the founding principles of this unkind world.

Kioki is a police detective, pushing through a tiresome day-job that only seems to expose her to the city's most miserable subjects. A search for a missing person turns into a murder investigation, leading her to recruit two old friends, men whose mortal bodies contain stranger souls. Tracking down her draconic suspect will lead her to someone she'd long since thought she lost.
